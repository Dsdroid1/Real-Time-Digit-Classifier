This folder contains a 2-layer MNIST Digit Classifier model which has:
          28*28 Input features
	        150 Hidden layer nodes 
	        10 output nodes corresponding to each class


It contains the trained parameters W1,b1,W2,b2 saved as .csv files using pandas.
They provide a 95% accuracy on MNIST datsets(train,dev/test)
To load them,use pandas.read_csv(PATH,header=None).
Preferably,store them in a dict() while loading.
To get more idea on using these trained parameters,refer the 'extern img predict' jupyter file
It contains the preprocessing required for the MNIST.
They have mentioned extracting the digit in a (20,20) image about the COM and padding to form a (28,28) image,
while retaining the same point(physical location changed) as the COM.
This preprocessing is there in this code, but it is not robust currently.....that it  may not work if the COM is abruptly shifted 
in the input image,in which case np.pad takes a -ve value,giving an error.
This can be improved.
