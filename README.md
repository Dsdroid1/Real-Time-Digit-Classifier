# Summer-Project-2019
Contains code,trained parameters etc for the NNs
This project was to explore the field of ML by implementing the 'Hello, World' of ML
i.e the MNIST Digit Recognition without using any external NN library(like tensorflow,keras etc)
It required studying the NNs from the base , knowing how their implementations work.
This contains all the basic functions written in Python for forward pass,cost function,backward pass and parameter update.

Later when the standard NN was implemented,we shifted to the CNNs.
For this, in assignments we wrote the code for forward and backward pass involving convolutions and pooling
but while implementation we did it in Pytorch(lib for NN).
This was done to ease the work and helped learn Pytorch from its documentation.
We did learn how the convolutions work in forward as well as in backward pass.
So with that knowledge,we were ready to move on to a NN library.

Thus ,we implemented the MNIST digit recog. via CNN to get a better accuracy(as expected).
